= structures-cxx
:author: Pedro Lamar√£o <pedro.lamarao@gmail.com>

`structures-cxx` is an experimental data structures library written in C++ 20 with modules for the Clang 18 compiler.

The objective of this experiment is to explore classic data structures (list, hoop, queue, stack, heap etc.) implemented alternatively onto contiguous and sparse memory, _i.e._ with memory *segments* and memory *nodes*.

Our hope is to achieve reusable, efficient search structures onto compact, contiguous memory.
