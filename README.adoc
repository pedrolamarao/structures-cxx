= structures-cxx
:author: Pedro Lamar√£o <pedro.lamarao@gmail.com>

`structures-cxx` is an experimental data structures library written in modular C++ 20.

The objective of this experiment is to explore classic data structures (list, hoop, queue, stack, heap etc.) implemented alternatively onto contiguous and sparse memory, _i.e._ structured onto memory *segments* or memory *nodes*, producing for example "segment heaps" and "node heaps".

We purposefully avoid certain names, such as _array_ and _iterator_, to avoid the corresponding assumptions.
For "production", we would rather reuse standard names em concepts.

We purposefully exaggerate in "modularization", defining every element in an exclusive module partition.
For "production", we would rather minimize the number of module partitions.
